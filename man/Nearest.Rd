\usage{
Nearest(dt, timeField = NULL, groupField = NULL, proportions = FALSE,
  coordFields = c("EASTING", "NORTHING"), idField = "ID")
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{Input data with coordinate and id fields. If not provided, fields
default to c('EASTING', 'NORTHING') and 'ID'}

\item{timeField}{(optional) timeField in the dt upon which the neighbors'
distance will be compared}

\item{groupField}{(optional) groupField in the dt which can be used to group
neighbors (eg: season, year, herd, known social groups, ...)}

\item{coordFields}{Character vector indicating the X coordinate and Y
coordinate columns. eg: c('EASTING', 'NORTHING')}

\item{idField}{Character string indicating the column name for the ID
associated with each point}
